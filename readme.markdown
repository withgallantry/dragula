Check the effect here: [table-dragger](https://sindu12jun.github.io/table-dragger/)

# Inspiration

Dragula is a powerful library, but it does not have animation effect when sorting,
which is really a pity. So I fork it and implement the feature.

# Install

You can get it on npm.

```shell
npm install dragula-with-animation --save
```

# Usage

All of the APIs are the same with dragula's
